            My hobby is drawing. I love to draw with different colours. Drawing gives me happiness. My most favourite time is when I come back from school because at that time I get free time to paint.
            I love to draw pokemon pictures on my notebook. They are my favourite drawings. My mother motivates me to draw more and more. In my school also, everyone loves my drawings.
            My mother and father always help me in getting coloured pencils, sketch pens etc. They become very happy because I do not waste time and do my drawing in free time. </p>
